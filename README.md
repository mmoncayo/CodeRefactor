# CodeRefactor
HW Assignment 1 

This homework assignment demonstrated the key importance of using semantic elements in HTML. It becomes very crucial to have a clear understanding of the code structure along with the flow of the content in index page when meaningful semantics are used. 

The assignment also helped me understand how to navigate between the choppy code by first looking at the final product (the external structure of the webpage) in order to understand how the internal structure of the page needed to be organized. Having a full picture visualization of the webpage helped me differentiate the blocks or sections of the code in order to accurately label the most appropriate elements in the HTML code. 

The CSS file also was able to be consolidated into concise groups of element styles so as to not have repetition in code for multiple sections. I was able to notice how much easier the code was to follow once proper labeling and simplifications were made in the CSS files. 

Overall I felt that this exercise helped me gain a better understanding as to why it's important that not only proper semantics are used in writing efficient code-- especially when you start working with bigger and more complex web pages-- but also the commenting is an important factor so as to continuously leave a line of communication between developers to see and understand what has been done to the code and what its purpose serves.
